## Description

The project is a basic version of a calendar app. It lets the user Add/ Edit/ Delete Reminders.
It also lets user color code their reminders. The app displays Event Details for the current date as well as all the events in 2 different tabs.

The app has used components primarily like angular-calendar and ng-bootstrap. Please do npm install to install all the essentials from package.json

The App is still in its initial phase and needs a lot of UI as well as logic improvement.
